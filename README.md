# Reception Robot Electricc Task

Reception Robot is designed to serve customers automatically without help of human. Robot smiling and move his hand whenever someone facing him within few centimeters. Ultrasonic sensor will be used to notice if any customer Infront of the reception robot, Camera also will be used to recognize if the person first time use this service or not. After ultrasonic sensor detect a customer, the robot will smile and do a welcome gesture and move his arm and then video will be display in the tablet.   

# electric part 

So, as electric task, the arm should be move using 6 servo motors. 3 servo motors used for right arm and the other 3 motors used for the left arm. The circuit design should be connected between the tablet, the 6 servo motors, Ultrasonic sensor, and Arduino UNO. if the target is away the sensor will display in the LCD screen the target far away and the servo motors will not change their position, but if the Ultrasonic detect a person within the range with camera will save his face and motors will start to move to do welcome gesture.

The circuit design is attached with the code.
